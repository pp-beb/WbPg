      Hello! I’m Prithak, a 20-year-old computer engineering student based in Banepa with a passion for technology and innovation. 
      I’m deeply interested in web development and programming, constantly exploring and learning to expand my skills in these dynamic fields.
      Creativity drives me, whether I’m crafting intuitive web designs or tackling complex coding challenges. 
      Alongside my technical pursuits, I’m an active and social individual who thrives in both leadership roles and 
      as a collaborative team member, always aiming to bring out the best in any group I’m part of. 
      With a curious mind and a dedication to growth, I’m excited to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology 
      while leaving a creative mark along the way.
      <br/><br/>
      I am driven by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, always eager to learn and grow in any way I can. While I humbly admit that there’s 
      still so much I don’t know, I embrace every opportunity to expand my horizons and improve myself. Whether it’s diving into new 
      technologies, tackling challenging tasks, or collaborating on exciting projects, I’m always ready to roll up my sleeves and contribute 
      in any way possible. I believe that every experience, big or small, is a stepping stone to becoming better, and I’m genuinely excited 
      to connect, learn, and create with like-minded individuals.
